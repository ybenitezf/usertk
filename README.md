# usertk

`UserTk` is a tool for network or site administrators who want to monitor the 
users activity through squid access log. For example, with `UserTK`, you can
implement a quota system for a proxy service.

The idea is to allow write pluggins that can process the data from the 
SQUID log and do with this information what you want, for example, 
store it in a table or send an email to the administrator.

*At this moment this project is just a alpha version not tested.*
